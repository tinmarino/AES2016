Welome to the AES encryptor tutorial by Tinmarino:

  1/ To cipher
  2/ Uncipher
  3/ Keys for ciphering
  4/ Keyboard shortcuts


---------------------------------------------
1/ Cipher:
    a/ Write or paste the text you want to cipher in the Left textArea.
    b/ The click on the button cipher (with a key as image).
If you did not enter a key, you will get a warning message, just read key section below. 
    c/ The text is cipher, it should start by IV1= you can now copy it and send it to a friend


---------------------------------------------
2/ Unipher:
    a/ Paste the text you want to uncipher in the main textArea, on the left of the screen
    b/ Click on the button cipher (currently the second) on the right side of the screen. 
If you did not enter a key, you will get a warning message, just read key section below. 
    c/ Is your text readable ? Maybe you got a warning because you entered a bad key and the padding is incorect. 
I imagine this is the unciphered text padding that is incoreect as the unciphered text looks like random shit. 


---------------------------------------------
3/ Keys for ciphering: how to set ?
    a/ Go in param screen with the (currently first) param button on the right right side of the mainScreen
    b/ Onces in Param you should see a (maybe null) list of saved key. You can just click on one of them to use it. 
    c/ Otherwise you can create a temporary key. In the "new Key" Chapter. 
        c1. You can use it and it will be destoyed when the app exits
        c2. Tou can save it and it will be stored, you will see its label in the saved key :
Of course I don't display the saved key as it is. Otherwise anyone could know its value.


---------------------------------------------
4/ Keyboard
    a/ Go Back   -> escape
    b/ Go foward -> F
